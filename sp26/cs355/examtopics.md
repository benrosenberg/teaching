Here are lists of topics to study for the exams.

# Midterm exam topics

## Linear algebra review

- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix inverse
- Solving $Ax = b$ for $x$
- Linear independence/invertibility for matrices

## Linear programming theory

- Knowing how many optimal solutions an LP can have
- Geometric interpretation of an LP's objective function
- Identifying whether a shape/set is convex or not
- Knowing runtime guarantees for LP solving
- Knowing why the feasible region of an LP is always convex

## LP modeling

- Knowing whether a constraint is modelable in a linear program
- Sketching feasible regions for an LP and determining whether it is feasible, infeasible, or unbounded, based on the feasible region and the objective function direction
- Being able to understand how the LP model of a problem we have seen in class, such as max flow, will be modified by the introduction of new elements (see HW 1 problem 18)

## LP integrality

- Knowing whether it is sufficient to have all integer $A, b, c$ to have a guarantee of obtaining an all-integer optimal solution for an LP
- Understanding whether modifications to an existing problem preserve integrality (see HW 1 problem 18)

## Runtime complexity analysis

- Being able to determine big-O time complexity for a Python function

Final exam topics will be posted later.
