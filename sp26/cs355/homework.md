# Homeworks

Homework instructions/advice:

- **Problems will be posted here periodically, until the homework is due.** What is posted here is not necessarily the full homework assigment.
- **Show your work** for all homework problems. Check your work with WolframAlpha, ChatGPT, your calculator, Python, MATLAB, or whatever other resource you want to use.
- All questions on the homework are weighted equally.
- If you wait until the full homework is due to start, you may have more difficulty completing it on time.
- If you have questions on the homework, please ask them in class.

## HW 1 (due date TBD)

### Linear algebra review

#### Problem 1

Define $A$ and $b$ as follows:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 7 & 6 \\ 4 & 1 & 4 \\ 3 & 8 & 7
\end{bmatrix}, b = \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 4 \\ 6
\end{bmatrix}$$

Solve the matrix-vector equation $Ax = b$ using row-reduction, where $A$ and $b$ are defined below. You should get integer results.

#### Problem 2

Define $A$ as follows:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 7 & 5 & 7 \\ 8 & 4 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$$

Show that $A$ is not invertible, and give a nontrivial solution to $Ax = 0$.

#### Problem 3

Define $A$ as follows:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 7 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$$

Find $AA^\intercal$.

#### Problem 4

Give a counterexample that shows matrix multiplication is not commutative for $2\times 2$ matrices.

#### Problem 5

Show that $I_2A = A$ for all matrices $A$ with dimension $2\times 2$.

More problems will be added...
