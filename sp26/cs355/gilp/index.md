# GILP pages

Hunter seems to have blocked GILP on their network for some reason, so here are some saved webpages that should be viewable from within Hunter's network.

Note that these require WebGL. Chrome or something Chrome-based is your best bet browser-wise.

- [All-integer 3D LP](./All%20Integer%203D%20LP%20—%20GILP%20documentation.html)
- [Dodecahedron 3D LP](./Dodecahedron%203D%20LP%20—%20GILP%20documentation.html)
- [Klee Minty 3D LP](./Klee%20Minty%203D%20LP%20—%20GILP%20documentation.html)
- [Multiple Optimal Solutions 3D LP](./Multiple%20Optimal%20Solutions%203D%20LP%20—%20GILP%20documentation.html)
