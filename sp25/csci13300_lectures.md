Information:

- I think the IT helpdesk was closed today (or at least they were when I went down to check). It seems like their hours are Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. Here is their contact information: [https://hunter.cuny.edu/information-technology/support/help-desk/](https://hunter.cuny.edu/information-technology/support/help-desk/)
  - Please try to get your netID set up by next class (Lecture 2, 2025-02-01) so that you can access the lab computers.
- I have posted the solutions for the additional tasks (1, 2, 2.5, and 3) on the [Unit 1 solutions page](unit_solutions/unit1_solution.html) (also linked above). The key for the Unit 1 solutions is `bumblebee`.
- I have posted the first assignment on the course site. You can access it from the course site homepage, or go directly here: [Assignment 1](unit_assessments/unit1_assessment.html)

Links:

- Python download page: [Download Python 3.10.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/)
  - Once you download Python, you should have IDLE installed on your computer. For information on using IDLE, see the "Learn something new" PDF file from Lecture 1 above.
