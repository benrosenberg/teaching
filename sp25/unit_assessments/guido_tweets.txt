In other news, we released mypy 0.620 today (https://t.co/ubs4nw7nUZ). It adds support for dataclasses, a major redo of overloads, support for partial packages, and more. Also PEP 561 support. Thanks to all contributors!

So I just learned there is no way to stop strangers (i.e. not "friends") from sending you chat requests on Facebook Messenger, even if all your privacy settings say "friends only".
My concern is not spammy notifications. It is very effective at not showing me any of those. My concern is that people who legitimately contact me that way don't get a bounce message, so I come off as rudely not responding. (I check facebook rarely, so it doesn't bother *me*.)

If youre using Python type annotations, please ask yourself whether it works when you add from __future__ import annotations.  This will be the default in 3.10 and we need you to prepare for that. (Also, 3.9.0 is now out.)
To clarify, this is part of PEP 563. It will affect inspect.signature() for annotated functions, the types come back stringified. E.g. (a: int) instead of (a: int). See https://t.co/ttb5cGPPrN
